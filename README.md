# Advancing Ship Re-Identification in the Wild: The ShipReID-2400 Benchmark Dataset and D2InterNet Baseline Method

## Abstract

Ship Re-Identification (ReID) aims to accurately identify ships with the same identity across different times and camera views, playing a crucial role in intelligent waterway transportation. Compared to the widely researched pedestrian and vehicle ReID, Ship ReID has received much less attention, primarily due to the scarcity of largescale, high-quality ship ReID datasets available for public access. Also, capturing an entire ship can be challenging due to their large size. The visible area of ships is also dynamic, often changing significantly because of variations in cargo loading or water waves. The unique challenges faced by ships make it difficult to achieve ideal results by directly applying existing ReID methods. To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce **ShipReID-2400**, a dataset for ship ReID compiled from a real-world intelligent waterway traffic monitoring system. It comprises 17,241 images of 2,400 distinct ship identities collected over 53 months, ensuring diversity and representativeness. Then, we propose a feature Disentangle-to-Interact Network (**D2InterNet**) for ship ReID, designed to extract discriminative local features despite significant scale variations. Given that distinctive local details are often tiny compared to the larger, less distinctive areas of ships, D2InterNet first employs a dual-branch architecture to separately focus on global and local features. Moreover, we introduce a Part-aware Feature Perception Module (PFPM) to enhance the extraction of local features, along with a Feature Interaction Module (FIM) and a Collaborative Interaction Learning Module (CILM) to effectively interact and integrate global and local features across different scales. Extensive experimental results show that D2InterNet achieves state-of-the-art ship ReID performance on both the ShipReID-2400 and VesselReID datasets. In addition, despite being designed for ship ReID, D2InterNet demonstrates comparable performance with the best methods on the MSMT17 pedestrian ReID dataset, showcasing its good generalization capability.

**Examples of ships from our ShipReID-2400 (images in each column are captures of the same ship identity from different cameras). As can be seen, we not only ensure that the captured images are of high quality but also obtain images of the same ship at different locations, angles, times, and weather conditions. For ease of presentation, the images here are scaled.**

**The overall architecture of our proposed D2InterNet. To address significant scale variation and extract discriminative local features for ship ReID, D2InterNet first uses a dual-branch architecture to independently focus on global and local features, enhanced by a Part-aware Feature Perception Module (PFPM) for better local feature capture. We then introduce Feature Interaction Modules (FIM) and Collaborative Interaction Learning Module (CILM) to interact and integrate features across scales. D2InterNet enables flexible dual-branch training and single-branch testing without additional computational overhead.**

### Image Naming Convention

`shipId_camId_idx_imgName`

e.g.: `2106_c003_01_T_20180703_15_38_50_734375.jpg`

| shipId | camId | Idx  |                   imgName                   |
| :----: | :---: | :--: | :-----------------------------------------: |
|  2106  | c003  |  01  |       T_20180703_15_38_50_734375.jpg        |

**shipId**: Assigned based on ship license plate. Different plates correspond to different shipIds. Range: `0 <= shipId < 2400`  
**camId**: Assigned based on camera location. Different locations correspond to different camIds. Range: `1 <= camId <= 8`  
**Idx**: Sequence number for images of the same shipId at the same camId. Example: The first image of shipId 2106 at location c003 is "01"  
**imgName**: Original image filename containing the image capture time  

### Dataset Partition

The 2400 ship IDs are randomly shuffled and split into **train**, **validation**, and **test** sets in a **0.75:0.125:0.125** ratio:  
- Randomly select **1800 IDs** → **Training Set**  
- Randomly select **300 IDs** → **Validation Set**  
- Randomly select **300 IDs** → **Test Set**  

Sets are **mutually exclusive**. During training:  
- Only the training set is used for weight updates  
- Validation and test sets are **solely for accuracy evaluation** (no impact on training)  

According to the re-identification task definition, both validation and test sets require corresponding **query sets**:  
- Query images are selected as **one image per ID per camera** to simulate real-world query scenarios  
- Validation query set: 691 images (300 IDs)  
- Test query set: 706 images (300 IDs)  

| Set                            | # ID | # Images |
| :----------------------------- | :--: | :------: |
| `bounding_box_train` (Train)   | 1800 | 12,988   |
| `val_query` (Validation Query) | 300  | 691      |
| `test_query` (Test Query)      | 300  | 706       |
| `bounding_box_test` (Gallery)  | 600  | 4,253    |
